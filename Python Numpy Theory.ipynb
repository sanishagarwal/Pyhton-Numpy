    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library that enhances Python’s capabilities for scientific computing and data analysis. Its core feature is the N-dimensional array (ndarray), which allows efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, offering significant performance improvements over Python’s built-in data structures like lists. Here's how NumPy contributes to scientific computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. __Purpose of NumPy:__\n",
    "- __Efficient numerical operations:__ NumPy is designed for fast and efficient numerical computations. It allows operations like addition, multiplication, and other mathematical functions to be performed element-wise on arrays.\n",
    "- __Multi-dimensional arrays:__ Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are essential in scientific computing.\n",
    "- __Mathematical functions and linear algebra:__ Includes numerous built-in mathematical functions such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic operations that are optimized for speed.\n",
    "- __Interoperability:__ It integrates easily with other scientific computing libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and matplotlib, enhancing Python’s ecosystem for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "- __Efficient memory usage:__ NumPy arrays are more compact and efficient than Python lists or tuples, consuming less memory.\n",
    "### 2. __Advantages of NumPy:__\n",
    "- __Performance improvement:__ NumPy arrays use contiguous memory blocks, allowing for fast and vectorized operations without the need for Python loops, which significantly speeds up numerical computations.\n",
    "- __Broadcasting:__ This feature allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes in an element-wise manner without explicitly reshaping or replicating data, simplifying code and improving performance.\n",
    "- __Vectorized operations:__ NumPy supports vectorized operations, allowing you to apply functions to entire arrays without the need for explicit loops, leading to cleaner and faster code.\n",
    "- __Multi-dimensional slicing:__ Arrays can be sliced in multiple dimensions, making it easier to extract and manipulate subsets of the data.\n",
    "- __Support for scientific functions:__ NumPy provides functions for matrix operations, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and many other scientific tasks, making it a cornerstone for scientific computing.\n",
    "- __Ease of integration with C/C++ and Fortran:__ NumPy arrays can be used in conjunction with C or Fortran code, making it easy to speed up critical parts of code.\n",
    "### 3. __Enhancement of Python’s Numerical Capabilities:__\n",
    "- __Optimized for large-scale data:__ With its efficient data structures and operations, NumPy allows Python to handle large datasets and perform complex computations that would be slower or more cumbersome using native Python.\n",
    "- __Faster computation for numerical operations:__ Since NumPy is implemented in C and optimized for performance, it dramatically accelerates tasks such as matrix multiplication, statistical analysis, and numerical simulation.\n",
    "- __Mathematical consistency:__ It ensures consistent and accurate floating-point operations, which are critical in scientific analysis."

    "- __Syntax:__ `np.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)`\n",

    "- __Axis argument:__ You can specify the axis along which to compute the mean.\n",

    "- __Syntax:__ `np.average(a, axis=None, weights=None, returned=False)`\n",
    "- __Weights:__ `np.average()` can accept an optional weights argument. This allows you to assign different importance (weights) to each element when calculating the average.\n",
    "    - If `weights=None`, it behaves like `np.mean()`.\n",
    "    - If weights are provided, it computes the weighted sum of elements divided by the sum of the weights.\n",
    "- __Axis argument:__ Similar to `np.mean()`, you can specify the axis along which to compute the average.\n",
    "- __Returned argument:__ If `returned=True`, it returns a tuple where the second value is the sum of the weights.\n",
    "- __When to use:__ Use `np.average()` when you need a weighted average, where certain elements contribute more to the average than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. __When to Use One Over the Other:__\n",
    "__Use `np.mean()`:__\n",
    "- When you want the simple arithmetic mean of the data.\n",
    "- When there are no weights involved in the calculation.\n",

    "In NumPy, an ndarray (N-dimensional array) is the core data structure used to store and manipulate large arrays of homogeneous data (i.e., all elements in the array must have the same data type). It is highly optimized for numerical computations and is the backbone of most operations in scientific computing with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Key Features of ndarray:__\n",
    "- __Homogeneous Data:__ All elements in an ndarray have the same data type (dtype), ensuring efficient storage and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __N-dimensional:__ As the name suggests, ndarray supports multi-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, or higher). A 1D array is like a vector, a 2D array is like a matrix, and higher-dimensional arrays can be used to represent complex datasets (e.g., images, volumes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Fixed Size:__ Once created, an ndarray has a fixed size, meaning you cannot change its shape without creating a new array or reshaping it.\n",

    "- __Efficient Memory Usage:__ Arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, allowing for more efficient memory usage and faster access compared to Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Support for Vectorized Operations:__ NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, which means you can perform element-wise operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication) without writing explicit loops. This leads to faster computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Broadcasting:__ NumPy arrays support broadcasting, a feature that allows operations between arrays of different shapes, under certain conditions. This allows for flexibility and avoids the need to reshape arrays manually in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Indexing and Slicing:__ ndarray supports advanced indexing and slicing, allowing you to access or modify specific elements, rows, columns, or subarrays efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Element-wise Operations:__ You can perform operations on individual elements or on the entire array at once, making ndarray ideal for mathematical computations.\n",
